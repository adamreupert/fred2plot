# FRED2Plot
FRamework for Experimental Data to Plot (FRED2Plot)

## Description
The framework for experimental data to plot (FRED2Plot), is designed to automatically process XRD, PDF, NMR, Raman, FT-IR & electrochemical Data and, if wanted, uploads them to Kadi4mat.

## Project status
This project is still in development!

## Visuals
Examples of Plots created with my code snippets for my master thesis. After fixing the UI those will be integrated in the Fred2plot sotware.

## Installation
All depending packages, needed to run those python scripts, are collected in the requirements.txt. To install them automatically just run the following command in your command line interface. 
Pip3 and Python3 has to be installed beforehand!

```
cd fred2plot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Examples will follow once the user interface is working out. Here is a small preview of the current state:
