# FRED2Plot
FRamework for Experimental Data to Plot (FRED2Plot)

## Description
The framework for experimental data to plot (FRED2Plot), is designed to automatically process XRD, PDF, NMR, Raman, FT-IR & electrochemical Data and, if wanted, uploads them to Kadi4mat.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
All depending packages, needed to run those python scripts, are collected in the requirements.txt. To install them automatically just run the following command in your command line interface. 
Pip and Python (preferably pip3/Python3) has to be installed beforehand!

```
cd fred2plot
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
- Integration of a UI made with TKinter
- Integration of all scripts into this UI
- Integration of Kadi4mat
- Integration of users (Kadi4mat)
- Integration of user collections and linking (Kadi4mat)

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
